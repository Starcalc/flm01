Welcome to the Flukso repository.

The repository is structured as follows:
* mote/v[1|2]/openwrt
The modules, patches and scripts needed to tailor a stock OpenWRT Backfire to
the Fluksometer hardware. The bulk of development will now be taking place in
the v2 directory which maps to the v2 hardware.
* mote/v[1|2]/eagle
The Eagle schematic, board and BOM files for building a v1 or v2 Flukso sensor
board.
* mote/v[1|2]/avr
The AVR microcontroller code for the Flukso sensor board.
* server/api
The Erlang/Webmachine code that handles the Flukso server's JSON/REST API.
* server/drupal
Custom Drupal v6 modules that transform a Drupal 6 installation into a community
metering web platform, see a.o. www.flukso.net or www.mysmartgrid.de.
