This repository holds the code for the community metering project called Flukso and is split into following subsections:
- web/drupal: theme and modules that turn a stock Drupal installation into www.flukso.net
- web/api: our Erlang/Webmachine-based JSON/REST code for api.flukso.net
- openwrt: contains openwrt packages/patches/make menuconfig to tweak a stock openwrt kamikaze build into a Fluksometer
- uc: the microcontroller code that is loaded onto the sensor board's AVR.

Enjoy!
Bart.
